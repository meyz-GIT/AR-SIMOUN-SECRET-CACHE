Ship I have a deck, but I'm not a card game. I'm made of steel, but I can float. What am I? 
RubberDuck I quack, but I'm not a frog. I have feathers, but I'm not a chicken. I can swim, but I'm not a fish. What am I? 
DeepPan I get hot when I'm on the fire, but I don't feel pain. I have a belly and a handle, but no arms or legs. What am I? 
Beer I can be bitter or sweet. I'm often a golden color and served cold in a glass. People raise a toast to me. What am I? 
Rock I'm hard and gray, and you can find me anywhere. I'm older than you, but I don't have a birthday. What am I? 
Money I can be earned, but I can't be bought. I can be spent, but I can't be used. What am I?
